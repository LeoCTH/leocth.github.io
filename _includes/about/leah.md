<span class="leah">Leah</span>, on the other hand, is the artist of our system.
She is a trans woman who uses <span class="she">she/her</span> pronouns.
She comes up whenever we need to create some art, or if she decides to dedicate 5+
hours of our life drawing in the night. She primarily creates oil paintings, though she
also uses digital tools like [GIMP].
[You can find some of her works here.](./leah.html#works)

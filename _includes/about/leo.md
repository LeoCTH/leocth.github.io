<span class="leo">Leo</span>, the host of the system, is the guy who made
this site for the two of us.
He is demi-male and heterosexual, and uses
<span class="pronoun he">he</span>/<span class="pronoun they">they</span>/<span class="pronoun she">she</span>
pronouns (we'll use <span class="pronoun he">he</span> for consistency).
He's a student-programmer who likes to use [Rust] as his primary programming language, 
though he is also proficient in [Kotlin], Java, TypeScript and more.

He has since made contributions to the Rust language itself, especially in its standard library.
He also contributed to [`messloc`] and [Modrinth]'s backend service, [Labrinth].
He also used to make Minecraft mods, which are available on [Modrinth] and [CurseForge].

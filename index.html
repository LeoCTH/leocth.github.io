        <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>
            We are the Dichotomy System, a small, <a href="https://pluralpedia.org/w/Parogenic">parogenic</a>
            <a href="https://morethanone.info">plural system</a> residing in a male body in his late teens.
            We consist of two members:
            <span class="leo">Leo</span>
            and <span class="leah">Leah</span>.
            We are currently based in China, identify as ethnically Chinese, and speak both English and (Standard)
            Chinese.

                    <span class="leo">Leo</span>, the host of the system, is the guy who made
                    this site for the two of us.
                    He is demi-male and heterosexual, and uses
                    <span class="he">he</span>/<span class="they">they</span>/<span class="she">she</span>
                    pronouns (we'll use <span class="he">he</span> for consistency).
                    He's a student-programmer who likes to use <a href="https://rust-lang.org">Rust</a>
                    as his primary programming language, though he is also proficient in
                    <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a>,
                    Java, TypeScript and more.

                </p>
                <p>
                    He has since made contributions to the Rust language itself, especially in its standard library.
                    He also contributed to
                    <a href="https://github.com/messloc/messloc"><code>messloc</code></a> and
                    <a href="https://modrinth.com">Modrinth</a>'s backend service,
                    <a href="https://github.com/modrinth/labrinth">Labrinth</a>.
                    He also used to make Minecraft mods, which are available on
                    <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/leocth">Modrinth</a> and
                    <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/members/leocth/projects">CurseForge</a>.

                <span class="leah">Leah</span>, on the other hand, is the artist of our system.
                She is a trans woman who uses <span class="she">she/her</span> pronouns.
                She comes up whenever we need to create some art, or if she decides to dedicate 5+
                hours of our life drawing in the night. She primarily creates oil paintings, though she
                also uses digital tools like <a href="https://gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.

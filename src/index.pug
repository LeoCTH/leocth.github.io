p.subtitle.is-4.
	You may know me by my online aliases,
	#[span.has-text-primary pluie] or #[span.has-text-primary pluiedev].

p.
	I'm a Chinese open-source developer 👩🏼‍💻,
	community manager 🔨👷🏼‍♀️,
	graphics designer and artist 👩🏼‍🎨,
	dedicated to making the world of digital technology and design accessible and
	inclusive for everyone.

p.
	I like to code, to draw, to discover myself, and to help others discover themselves.
	More things I like include dogs and traffic cones. And linguistics.
	Especially #[abbr(title="constructed languages, or languages intentionally created by people") conlangs].
	They're #[em very] cool.

p.
	Currently, I'm busy working with #[a(href="https://quiltmc.org") QuiltMC] to create a safe,
//- 	inclusive space for modded Minecraft players and developers.
//- 	[As one of Quilt's Moderators](https://quiltmc.org/about/teams/#moderators),
//- 	I help keep the discriminatory, hurtful, problematic people out, and the respectful,
//- 	sincere, welcoming people in. So far, I think I'm doing an okay job.

//- I work with Quilt on a technical level too -- I contribute code and reviews to
//- [Quilt Kotlin Libraries (QKL)](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-kotlin-libraries),
//- a library allowing Kotlin users such as myself to use Quilt's APIs easier and more idiomatically.
//- I also help maintaining [Quilt's website](https://quiltmc.org),
//- [including modernizing the codebase](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltmc.org/pull/58)
//- to be based on [Astro](https://astro.build) instead of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

//- Even though recently I've been using Kotlin, JavaScript, Sass and other languages as
//- a Quilt developer, I'm still a proud [Rustacean :crab:](https://rust-lang.org/) at heart.
//- I often teach beginners in Rust how to improve their Rust skills and think in
//- the Rust mindset -- both in real life and on platforms like
//- [the Rust Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community) --
//- and I'm excited to see the people I helped become true Rust masters.

//- When I'm not busy moderating a community or coding or sitting in my chair idling,
//- I create drawings and paintings! I'm primarily an oil painter, though I use
//- [GIMP](https://gimp.org) to create digital illustrations, like my own avatar and more.

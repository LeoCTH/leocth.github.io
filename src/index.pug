	I'm a Chinese open-source developer üë©üèº‚Äçüíª,
	community manager üî®üë∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,
	graphics designer and artist üë©üèº‚Äçüé®,
	dedicated to making the world of digital technology and design accessible and
	inclusive for everyone.

	I like to code, to draw, to discover myself, and to help others discover themselves.
	More things I like include dogs and traffic cones. And linguistics.
	Especially <abbr title="constructed languages, or languages intentionally created by people">conlangs</abbr>.
	They're _very_ cool.
	
	I also often think way too hard about narrative video games, to the point
	I write full articles and reviews about them. I'm not exactly professional,
	but I still try my best to figure out what does and doesn't tick!

			Currently, I'm spending most of my attention and energy on two things:
			community management and moderation, and contributing to and creating various
			open-source projects.

			As a [community manager of the Quilt Project](https://quiltmc.org/about/teams/#community-managers),
			a modding toolchain project primarily designed for Minecraft,
			I work on policies, guidelines and tooling that drives Quilt towards its goal of creating a
			healthy, diverse, multicultural community striving to accomodate all sorts of minorities,
			be they ethnic or racial minorities, sexual and/or gender-nonconfirming minorities, neurodivergent minorities,
			or any other group of people facing unique challenges and adversities in the wider world.

			More specifically, my unique identity and lived experience provide me ample resources to
			diversify communities beyond the dominant Western, predominantly-white cultural sphere,
			which is unfortunately still the sole major cultural sphere in most technology-related communities.
			I hope that through my efforts people from all sorts of different backgrounds can find
			communities I manage comfortable and

		//- 	inclusive space for modded Minecraft players and developers.
		//- 	[As one of Quilt's Moderators](https://quiltmc.org/about/teams/#moderators),
		//- 	I help keep the discriminatory, hurtful, problematic people out, and the respectful,
		//- 	sincere, welcoming people in. So far, I think I'm doing an okay job.

		//- I work with Quilt on a technical level too -- I contribute code and reviews to
		//- [Quilt Kotlin Libraries (QKL)](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-kotlin-libraries),
		//- a library allowing Kotlin users such as myself to use Quilt's APIs easier and more idiomatically.
		//- I also help maintaining [Quilt's website](https://quiltmc.org),
		//- [including modernizing the codebase](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltmc.org/pull/58)
		//- to be based on [Astro](https://astro.build) instead of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

		//- Even though recently I've been using Kotlin, JavaScript, Sass and other languages as
		//- a Quilt developer, I'm still a proud [Rustacean :crab:](https://rust-lang.org/) at heart.
		//- I often teach beginners in Rust how to improve their Rust skills and think in
		//- the Rust mindset -- both in real life and on platforms like
		//- [the Rust Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community) --
		//- and I'm excited to see the people I helped become true Rust masters.

		//- When I'm not busy moderating a community or coding or sitting in my chair idling,
		//- I create drawings and paintings! I'm primarily an oil painter, though I use
		//- [GIMP](https://gimp.org) to create digital illustrations, like my own avatar and more.

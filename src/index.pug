				I'm a Chinese open-source developer üë©üèº‚Äçüíª,
				community manager üî®üë∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,
				graphics designer and artist üë©üèº‚Äçüé®,
				dedicated to making the world of digital technology and design accessible and
				inclusive for everyone.

				I love coding, drawing, painting, discovering more about myself, and helping others discover and express themselves.
				Funnily enough, I do most of my productive work in my spare time when I'm supposed to relax‚Äîapparently,
				once I get fixated on something, I can't stop. Not sure if that's a good quality or not! ;)

				More things I like include dogs, traffic cones, history, politics and linguistics.
				Especially <abbr title="constructed languages, or languages intentionally created by people">conlangs</abbr>.
				They're _very_ cool.
				
				I also often think way too hard about narrative video games, to the point
				I write full articles and reviews about them. I'm not exactly professional,
				but I still try my best to figure out what does and doesn't tick!

				Currently, I spend most of my attention and energy on two things:
				community management and moderation, and contributing to and creating various
				open-source projects.

				As one of the [community managers](https://quiltmc.org/about/teams/#community-managers)
				of [the Quilt Project](https://quiltmc.org), a modding toolchain project primarily designed for Minecraft,
				I work on policies, guidelines and tooling that drives Quilt towards its goal of creating
				a healthy, diverse, multicultural community striving to accomodate all sorts of minorities,
				be they ethnic or racial minorities, sexual and/or gender-nonconfirming minorities, neurodivergent minorities,
				or any other group of people facing various challenges and adversities in world society.

				My unique identity as a queer, lesbian Chinese trans woman with an international,
				multicultural mindset provides me with ample amounts of lived experience with
				diversifying communities beyond the dominant Western, mostly Anglophone,
				predominantly white, cis- and heteronormative culture,
				which is unfortunately still the sole major cultural environment in most tech-focused communities.
				I hope that, through my efforts, heterogeneous people from diverse backgrounds can find
				communities that I manage comfortable, and be free from having to mask their cultural heritage,
				like when I first ventured into international technical communities.

				As an open-source contributor, I occasionally submit patches and pull requests to
				projects I find interesting, mostly in Rust, TypeScript and Kotlin.
				I also maintain Quilt's community tooling, mainly [its official website](https://quiltmc.org)
				and its [Developer Wiki](https://modder.wiki.quiltmc.org/), and sometimes its own 
				Discord bot called [Cozy](https://github.com/QuiltMC/cozy-discord).
				I also started some other random projects, one of which is a
				[Rust rewrite of the `alien` tool](https://github.com/pluiedev/alien),
				originally a Perl utility script that converts Linux software packages between various formats
				(e.g.: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.tgz`, ...) for different package managers (e.g.: `dpkg`/`apt`, `rpm`/`dnf`, ...)

				I'm almost always coding something new, for existing projects or otherwise,
				and I can't wait to show you more! For now, you'll just have to wait for me to update this
				portfolio again sometime in the future...

			I'm a Chinese open-source developer üë©üèº‚Äçüíª,
			community manager üî®üë∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,
			graphics designer and artist üë©üèº‚Äçüé®,
			dedicated to making the world of digital technology and design accessible and
			inclusive for everyone.

			I love coding, drawing, painting, discovering more about myself, and helping others discover and express themselves.
			Funnily enough, I do most of my productive work in my spare time when I'm supposed to relax‚Äîapparently,
			once I get fixated on something, I can't stop. Not sure if that's a good quality or not! ;)

			More things I like include dogs, traffic cones, history, politics and linguistics.
			Especially <abbr title="constructed languages, or languages intentionally created by people">conlangs</abbr>.
			They're _very_ cool.
			
			I also often think way too hard about narrative video games, to the point
			I write full articles and reviews about them. I'm not exactly professional,
			but I still try my best to figure out what does and doesn't tick!

			Currently, I spend most of my attention and energy on two things:
			community management and moderation, and contributing to and creating various
			open-source projects.

			As one of the [community managers](https://quiltmc.org/about/teams/#community-managers)
			of [the Quilt Project](https://quiltmc.org), a modding toolchain project primarily designed for Minecraft,
			I work on policies, guidelines and tooling that drives Quilt towards its goal of creating
			a healthy, diverse, multicultural community striving to accomodate all sorts of minorities,
			be they ethnic or racial minorities, sexual and/or gender-nonconfirming minorities, neurodivergent minorities,
			or any other group of people facing various challenges and adversities in world society.

			My unique identity as a queer, lesbian Chinese trans woman with an international,
			multicultural mindset provides me with ample amounts of lived experience with
			diversifying communities beyond the dominant Western, mostly Anglophone,
			predominantly white, cis- and heteronormative culture,
			which is unfortunately still the sole major cultural environment in most tech-focused communities.
			I hope that, through my efforts, heterogeneous people from diverse backgrounds can find
			communities that I manage comfortable, and be free from having to mask their cultural heritage,
			like when I first ventured into international technical communities.

			As an open-source contributor, I occasionally submit patches and pull requests to
			projects I find interesting, mostly in Rust, TypeScript and Kotlin.
			I also maintain Quilt's community tooling, mainly [its official website](https://quiltmc.org)
			and its [Developer Wiki](https://modder.wiki.quiltmc.org/), and sometimes its own 
			Discord bot called [Cozy](https://github.com/QuiltMC/cozy-discord).
			I also started some other random projects, one of which is a
			[Rust rewrite of the `alien` tool](https://github.com/pluiedev/alien),
			originally a Perl utility script that converts Linux software packages between various formats
			(e.g.: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.tgz`, ...) for different package managers (e.g.: `dpkg`/`apt`, `rpm`/`dnf`, ...)

			I'm almost always coding something new, for existing projects or otherwise,
			and I can't wait to show you more! For now, you'll just have to wait for me to update this
			portfolio again sometime in the future...

# Hello ðŸ‘‹

We are the Dichotomy System (or Dichosys for short), a small
[plural system][morethanone] residing in a male body in his late teens.
We consist of two members: <Folk member="leo"/> and <Folk member="leah"/>.
We are currently based in China, identify as ethnically Chinese, and speak
both English and (Standard) Chinese.

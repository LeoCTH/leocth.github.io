<h1 class="title is-2">

Heya~ I'm <span class="has-text-primary">Leah</span>!

</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle is-5">

You may know me better by my screen name,
<span class="has-text-primary">pluie</span>
or <span class="has-text-primary">pluiedev</span>.

</h2>

I'm a community moderator :hammer: / coder :computer: / amateur artist :art: /
procrastinator :zzz: / etc. from China.

I like to code, to draw, to discover myself, and to help others discover themselves.
More things I like include dogs and traffic cones. And linguistics.
Especially <abbr title="constructed languages (languages intentionally created by people)">conlangs</abbr>.
They're _very_ cool.

I'm transgender 🏳️‍⚧️, transfeminine and lesbian, and I use feminine pronouns
(she/her/她) -- please keep that in mind before interacting with me,
as I can only respect you if you respect me first.

## What I'm working on

Currently, I'm busy working with [QuiltMC](https://quiltmc.org) to create a safe,
inclusive space for modded Minecraft players and developers.
[As one of Quilt's Moderators](https://quiltmc.org/about/teams/#moderators),
I help keep the discriminatory, hurtful, problematic people out, and the respectful,
sincere, welcoming people in. So far, I think I'm doing an okay job.

I work with Quilt on a technical level too -- I contribute code and reviews to
[Quilt Kotlin Libraries (QKL)](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-kotlin-libraries),
a library allowing Kotlin users such as myself to use Quilt's APIs easier and more idiomatically.
I also help maintaining [Quilt's website](https://quiltmc.org),
[including modernizing the codebase](https://github.com/QuiltMC/quiltmc.org/pull/58)
to be based on [Astro](https://astro.build) instead of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).

Even though recently I've been using Kotlin, JavaScript, Sass and other languages as
a Quilt developer, I'm still a proud [Rustacean :crab:](https://rust-lang.org/) at heart.
I often teach beginners in Rust how to improve their Rust skills and think in
the Rust mindset -- both in real life and on platforms like
[the Rust Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/rust-lang-community) --
and I'm excited to see the people I helped become true Rust masters.

When I'm not busy moderating a community or coding or sitting in my chair idling,
I create drawings and paintings! I'm primarily an oil painter, though I use
[GIMP](https://gimp.org) to create digital illustrations, like my own avatar and more.

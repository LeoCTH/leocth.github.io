# Hello ðŸ‘‹

We are the Dichotomy System (or Dichosys for short), a small, [parogenic][parogenic]
[plural system][morethanone] residing in a male body in his late teens.
We consist of two members: <span class="leo">Leo</span> and <span class="leah">Leah</span>.
We are currently based in China, identify as ethnically Chinese, and speak both English and (Standard)
Chinese.

# Every (pride) flag this site knows.
# Feel free to add more IDK this is all we need at this point

# Structure for each entry:
# <flag id>:
#   # Name of the identity this flag represents
#   name: string
#
#   # The correct link to use for the redirect to an terminology page on en.pronouns.page.
#   # For example, the flag/identity known as 'demimale' here has a corresponding section
#   # called 'demiboy' under the link https://en.pronouns.page/dictionary/terminology#demiboy.
#   #
#   # Defaults to the flag ID.
#   pronouns-page-redirect: string
#
#   # Whether this flag is actually a pride flag.
#   # Flags representing non-queer identities such as heterosexuality are traditionally not
#   # considered as pride flags. We're putting them in the same place as true pride flags
#   # because we use the same routines and mechanisms to draw these flags. Deal with it.
#   #
#   # Defaults to true.

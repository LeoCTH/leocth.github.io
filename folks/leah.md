## Description

The artist of the system. Fledgling trans woman. Pops up when we need to do anything art-related.

Seems to be particularly fixated on self-portraits and images demonstrating female posture. Likes to use
proper punctuation and capitalization, unlike Leo. Also unlike Leo, she can actually get her projects
done with fanatic attention and dedication. May have OCD (?)

Oh by the way, I drew my avatar myself.

## Works
